  <h2>Nmap cardiology using nmap scripting to test the heartbleed bug</h2>
</div>

<div id="post">
<p>A few days ago the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed bug</a> came out which allowed attackers to read the memory of systems using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL. <em>Reading the memmory</em> will allow attackers to steal even the encryption keys which make <em>all<em/> secure traffic <em>ever</em> monitored to and from one of these systems decryptable. But, that happened a whole two days ago (as of when I put fingers to keyboard on this piece). If you are reading this blog, you probobly know that. So, what I decided to do this morning is to build a script to identify, and notify, vulnerable systems.

<p>I have wanted to use the <a href="http://nmap.org/">Nmap<a/> <a href="http://nmap.org/book/nse.html"> scripting engine</a> for quite some time now. Nmap is a (========EXPLAIN WHAT IS NMAP HERE======). I enjoy using Nmap, but I find the command line flags cumborsom. Nmap implemented a <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> based scripting engine in 2007. (=========WHY ME, WHY LUA, WHY FUN=======).</p>

<p>To start I need to gather my tools. Nmap has a robust <a href="http://nmap.org/nsedoc/">script library</a> already, and I don't want to write what I don't have to. Heartbleed was orginally released on April 7th 2014.  It is 7:50am on April 9th and there is already a Heartbleed vulnerability scripted up and uploaded to the script library... I am as dissapointed as you are. But, since this was supposed to simply be a nmap scripting lesson, and open source is rooted in reuse, we are not going to re-implement this from scratch. Instead, we are going to use this script to make a vulnerability notifier.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is set up our script. This simply means that I write a description, author information, licsence, and assign this script to a set of categories. 

<pre>
description = [[
Identifies servers who are vulnerable to heartbleed and then notifies the current owner of the ip address with an e-mail. 
]]

author = "Seamus Tuohy <s2e@seamustuohy.com>"
license = "Same as Nmap--See http://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html"
categories = { "vuln", "safe", "discovery"}
</pre>
