title: German for German's Sake
---


  <p>The <a href="http://www.deutschlandstiftung.net/" target="_blank">German Foundation for Integration</a> is releasing a series of ads aimed at encouraging immigrants to learn German and integrate culturally. This, just after the news that &#8220;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451" target="_blank">the German Multi-Cultural Society has failed</a>&#8220;.</p></p>

<p>I read a report on <a href="http://saalt.org/attachments/1/From%20Macacas%20to%20Turban%20Toppers%20Report.small.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;The Rise in Xenophobic and Racist Rhetoric in American Political Discourse&#8221;</a> From <a href="http://saalt.presstools.org/node/36213?q=node%2F36213">SAALT</a> the other day that has put me on alert for Xenophobia and Nationalism. The news recently in Germany is looking quite grim for immigrants. No <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/13/france-deportation-roma-illegal-memo" target="_blank">worse</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11323053" target="_blank">than</a> <a href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=121805" target="_blank">France</a>, but quite grim. I have no theory on the why &#8211; <a href="http://nohomonationalism.blogspot.com/2010/06/judith-butler-refuses-berlin-pride.html" target="_blank">Butler</a> is surely on this- but, Nationalistic and Xenophobic spasms are being seen in Germany, as they are surely seen all over the world, and it fucking terrifies me.</p>
