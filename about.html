<center><img src="/images/Seamus.png"></center>
<p>I build and utilize tools for improving secure communication for communities that are affected by conflict.  Currently, I work mainly building tools that allow users to take advantage of mesh networking technologies and the oppourtunities that pseudonimous, locality based connectivity can bring. (I build user-facing mesh networking tools)</p>
<p>You can find me at a bar by my giggling at publications that &#8220;solve&#8221; The Byzantine Generals problem with ever increasing CPU power, or hastely scrawling down the few solutions that might run on embedded devices. On those quieter evenings I am trying to translate dispute system design into digital spaces, or plotting a Rube Goldberg of a craft project.</p>
<p>I am also better at handstands than you are.</p>
